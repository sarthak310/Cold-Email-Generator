# ðŸ“§ Cold Mail Generator
Cold email generator using groq, langchain and streamlit. It allows users to input the URL of a company's job posting. The tool then extracts job requirements from the job description and generates personalized cold emails. These emails include relevant portfolio/github/project links sourced from a vector database, based on the specific job descriptions.
